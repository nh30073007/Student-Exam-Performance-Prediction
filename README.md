# 🎓 Student Exam Performance Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict students' performance in exams based on multiple demographic and academic factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation. Ideal for educators, policy makers, and learning platforms.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict students’ math, reading, and writing scores
- Analyze which features impact student performance the most
- Use multiple regression models for accuracy comparison

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Label Encoding

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Info

  - Lunch type
  - Test preparation course
  - Scores: Math, Reading, Writing

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualized relationships between:
  - Gender vs Scores
  - Parental education vs Performance
  - Test preparation vs Score improvement
- Distribution plots and correlation matrix

---

## 🧠 Model Training

- Applied models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
